# Modding Introduction

These are the instructions for setting up a development environment for Dash itself. This is useful if you want to submit pull requests to us or make your own mod.

:::warning
Heads up. This page is a bit outdated :(

We'll try to get it fixed soon (writing this on Jul 9 2026, did we forget?)
:::

If you just want to develop custom extensions, see [the custom extension documentation](./extensions/introduction.md) instead.

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

All of our packages need [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (likely anything v18 or later works, but we can't promise that). We assume you are familiar with the command line.

Some packages may want some additional things installed, so check the README in each package you want to develop.

Dash is a large app that can require multiple gigabytes of disk space and memory to build.

## A note on how Dash is organized {#organization}

Scratch and it's mods are broken up into a bunch of different packages, each implementing one part of the app.

 - **scratch-gui** implements much of the interface (eg. the sprite list), connects everything together, and is where addons live
 - **scratch-vm** runs projects. It's where the compiler lives
 - **scratch-render-fonts** contains all the fonts that SVG costumes can use (PenguinMod renames this to **penguinmod-render-fonts** - currently Dash has the same naming)
 - **scratch-paint** is the costume editor (PenguinMod renames this to **PenguinMod-Paint** - currently Dash has the same naming)
 - **scratch-parser** extracts and validates sb2, sb3 and dbp files
 - **scratch-audio** is the audio engine. It's where sound effects and sounds itself playing

Additional packages that only Dash has.

- **assets** is where Dash's backdrops, costumes and sounds for GUI's libraries live

Other packages which you can clone from Scratch and it's other mods (currently, we don't have them).

 - **scratch-render** is what displays things like the stage, sprites, text bubbles, and pen. It also implements blocks like "touching". Note that things that are rendered on top of sprites such as variable monitors are actually part of scratch-gui.
 - **scratch-svg-renderer** helps fix various SVG rendering problems (TurboWarp renames this to **@turbowarp/scratch-svg-renderer**)
 - **scratch-storage** is an abstraction around fetch() used for downloading (and theoretically uploading) files (TurboWarp renames this to **@turbowarp/scratch-storage**)
 - **scratch-l10n** contains some translations (TurboWarp renames this to **@turbowarp/scratch-l10n**)

In addition, the desktop app and packager are also support repositories.

## Building the GUI {#gui}

If you want to mod Dash, you'll need to be able to build the GUI. This is a common pattern you'll use for developing on Dash packages:

```bash
# clone it
git clone https://github.com/DashBlocks/scratch-gui
cd scratch-gui

# install dependencies (preferred over `npm install` as it is faster and won't modify package-lock.json)
# if this fails try running npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
# and if it still fails try running npm install or npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm ci

# start development playground
npm start
```

This starts the live development server for most packages, if there is one. For example, for scratch-gui, the playground can be accessed at [http://localhost:8601/](http://localhost:8601/). See the README or the output of `npm start` for information for other packages.

## Build {#build}

While `npm start` is useful for development, at some point you'll need to get raw files out. You can do this with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `build` folder.

When deploying Dash to a live website, you should enable production mode. This will result in faster execution and a greatly reduced file size:

```bash
# mac, linux
NODE_ENV=production npm run build

# windows command prompt (untested)
set NODE_ENV=production
npm run build

# windows powershell
$env:NODE_ENV="production"
npm run build
```

By default Dash generates links like `https://dashblocks.org/editor.html#123`. However, by setting the variables `ROOT=/` and `ROUTING_STYLE=wildcard` (in the same way that you set `NODE_ENV=production`), you can get routes like `https://dashblocks.org/123/editor` instead. Note that this requires a server that will setup the proper aliases. The webpack development server in scratch-gui is setup for this. For production you'd want something more like https://github.com/TurboWarp/turbowarp.org.
Note that Dash's community likely won't work for your mod, that's because we sat up CORS, have a server to get information from our community.

## Linking other packages {#linking}

Linking packages lets you run use your local versions of packages in your other local packages. So you can use your local scratch-vm inside your local scratch-gui. That lets you actually see what your scratch-vm changes do in a real GUI.

We used to recommend using `npm link` to do this. Unfortunately, npm is an awful piece of software that gets worse every update. This command used to work perfectly, but they broke it because of course. It's now better to manually create symlinks yourself in node_modules. (We are amazed how they were able to take a perfectly functional command and make it slow and break if you go more than one level deep)

We need to update this section still to reflect the new recommendations. In the mean time `npm link` does somewhat still work if you only need to go one level deep and are okay with waiting a long time for what should be a single system call.

To develop packages other than scratch-gui, you need to tell npm to use local copies of the package instead of the ones it downloaded from the internet. This is called *linking*. The pattern is:

```bash
# clone the package you want to develop in the same folder as scratch-gui
# (folder doesn't really matter but it makes things easier to keep track of)
cd scratch-gui/..
git clone https://github.com/DashBlocks/scratch-vm

# install dependencies in the child package
cd scratch-vm
npm ci

# tell npm that this is your local copy of the package
npm link

# for some packages (eg. storage, svg-renderer), you may need to build for your changes to apply
npm run build

# tell scratch-gui to use your local copy of the package
cd ../scratch-gui
npm link scratch-vm
```
