# Offline Packager

There are ways to use the [Dash Packager](https://dashblocks.github.io/packager/) offline which can be useful in various circumstances (for example, perhaps your school blocks dashblocks.github.io).

We aim to update the offline packager about once a month.

Large assets such as Electron, NW.js, or WKWebView executables are *not* included in the offline packager and will be downloaded separately as needed. The packager will try to cache these files offline after you download them the first time, so they should only have to be downloaded once. Usually these downloads will still work even if your school blocks dashblocks.github.io.

## Desktop App {#desktop}

You can download [Dash Desktop](https://dashblocks.github.io/desktop.html/), which includes an offline version of the packager. You can access it by pressing the "File" button in the top left corner then select the packager.

The built-in packager will automatically load the project you have open in the editor.
